# Boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Coronary Heart Disease Prediction


In this project, we used Boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict coronary heart disease (CHD) with the SAheart dataset.

Boosting: We used gradient boosting to sequentially build decision trees, improving the model by focusing on previous errors. Cross-validation helped select the optimal number of trees, and we evaluated the final model on test data.

SVMs: We explored three SVM kernels (Linear, Radial, Polynomial) to handle both linear and non-linear patterns. We tuned key parameters (like cost, gamma, and degree) using cross-validation and evaluated the best models on test data.

Result: Both methods were optimized and compared using the misclassification rate, showcasing how to apply and fine-tune these models for classification tasks.
